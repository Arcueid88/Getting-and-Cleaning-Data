# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is a Github repo with the code for performing my analysis. The code  have a file run_analysis.R in the main directory that can be run as long as the Samsung data is in my working directory. The output is the tidy data set I submitted for part 1. A README.md is included in the repo describing how the script works and the code book describing the variables.

Step 1: Download and unzip the source data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

Step 2: Move the data into my R working directory. (D:\R)

Step 3: Run run_analysis.R which is written in my R working directory.

Step 4: Use data <- read.table("final_dataset_with_avg.txt") to read the data. 
(Note: It is 180x68 because there are 30 subjects and 6 activities)
